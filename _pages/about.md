__Current position__: Lead data scientist at [Fuelbetter Technologies](https://www.fuelbetter.co/){:target="\_blank"} (London, UK).

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2013, working on splitting methods for Langevin Dynamics (see my thesis here). I was a postdoc in Statistics at The University of Chicago (2014-2018) and a postdoc in Machine Learning methods at The University of Edinburgh (2018-2019).

I enjoy working on practical problems at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. In the past I've worked on novel integration methods for molecular dynamics, Bayesian sampling schemes for cosmology, and neural networks in renewable energy.

I mostly write code in Python (Python 3, Jupyter, Cython), but can be found also developing in C/C++/C#. Experienced in SQL, Fortran, Java and Javascript as well.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
